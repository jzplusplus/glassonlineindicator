Glass Online Indicator
====================

Normally, Glass has no way of showing you that there isn't an internet connection on the home card. It sucks when you're trying to demo for someone and you get a big "Not connected to the internet" screen because you didn't realize you weren't connected.

APK is available [here](https://github.com/jzplusplus/glassonlineindicator/releases/tag/v0.1).

When you turn on the screen, a translucent box will show over the "ok, glass" section of the main card.  
If you have an internet connection, it is green. Otherwise, red.
